- 👋 Hi, I’m @JavierDiazV an Industrial Engineer from Chile, currently looking for a Job opportunity as a Data Analyst, local, remote or hopefully in Amsterdam.  
I am a data nerd searching for a data focused job, also I am a detailed and goal oriented professional with +8 years of experience in data analytics 
applied to Performance Control, Planning, Forecasting and Team management, navigating through Sales, call center and CRM  information, sometimes from Excel sheets, 
mostly from SQL servers and even a couple of times from a pile of paper.  
I have a passion for solving complex problems and for transforming data and presenting it. I love puzzles and I feel that every data analytics project is like one.  
I have another passion, I also love coffee culture, I had the opportunity of being an entrepreneur opening my first Specialty Coffee Shop, so I had to learn everything 
that it is to know about coffee, and I became really good at it. I even learned how to be a Barista and a Host. Sadly Covid hitted and I had to close my shop. 
But I'm starting again, and I am going to do everything in my power to reopen it in the future😀. My dream is to have a little office inside my coffee shop 
so I can work in data projects and oversee my shop in parallel, whilst drinking a flat white of course.
Also I love hearing and sharing life stories, hobbies, passion projects and pop culture.


- 👀 I’m interested in mainly SQL, PowerBI and R and everything related to data analytics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R and Pyhton will be next.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data related projects.
